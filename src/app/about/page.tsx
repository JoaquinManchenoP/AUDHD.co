          <p>Hi! ðŸ‘‹</p>

          <p>Thanks for checking us out.</p>

          <p>
            AuDHD.co started because we got tired of seeing the same old advice
            that just doesn't work for neurodivergent brains. You know the ones
            - "just make a list" or "try harder to focus." Yeah, right.
          </p>

          <p>
            We're building something different here. A place where ADHD and
            autistic folks can find strategies that actually make sense for how
            our brains work. No BS, no "miracle cures," just real stuff that
            helps.
          </p>

          <p>Here's what we're about:</p>

          <ul className="space-y-4 list-none">
            <li className="pl-4 border-l-2 border-[#fcc029]">
              â€¢ We're all neurodivergent here. No outside "experts" telling us
              what to do - just real people sharing what actually works.
            </li>
            <li className="pl-4 border-l-2 border-[#fcc029]">
              â€¢ We only share stuff we've tried ourselves. If it doesn't work in
              real life, you won't find it here.
            </li>
            <li className="pl-4 border-l-2 border-[#fcc029]">
              â€¢ Our community keeps growing - over 5,000 people read our weekly
              notes. Pretty cool to see we're not alone in this.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Look, we've tried all those fancy productivity systems and life
            hacks too. Most of them flopped hard. But that's okay - each fail
            taught us something new about what actually works for brains like
            ours.
          </p>

          <p>
            Now we share what works through our newsletter and guides. No fluff,
            no corporate speak, just straightforward strategies you can actually
            use.
          </p>

          <p>Stick around - we think you'll like it here.</p>
